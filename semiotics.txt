semiotic function
the semiotic function
    The ability to create representations.
    
    It’s based on the use of signs and symbols
    that have distinct signifieds and
    signifiers.

signifier

denotation
    A translation of a sign to its meaning,
    precisely to its literal meaning, more or
    less like dictionaries try to define it.
    
    Denotation is sometimes contrasted to
    connotation, which includes associated
    meanings

    In logic, linguistics and semiotics, the
    denotation of a word or phrase is a part
    of its meaning; however, the part referred
    to varies by context:

    - In grammar and literary theory, the
      literal meaning or "dictionary
      definition" of a term, devoid of
      emotion, attitude, and color.

    - In semiotics, the surface or literal
      meaning of a signifier.

    - In logic, formal semantics and parts of
      linguistics, the extension of a term.

connotation
    A connotation is a commonly understood
    cultural or emotional association that any
    given word or phrase carries, in addition
    to its explicit or literal meaning, which
    is its denotation.

    Example: ♡
        The denotation is a representation of
        a cartoon heart. The connotation is a
        symbol of love and affection.

renvoi
    The effect distinctive of signs.
    
    For one thing so to stand for another that
    that other is made manifest to or for yet
    another still.

physiosemiosis
    [#Basics of Semiotics]

    Laid down the argument that the action of
    signs extends even further than life, and
    that semiosis as an influence of the
    future played a role in the shaping of the
    physical universe prior to the advent of
    life, a role for which Deely coined the
    term physiosemiosis.

translation semiotics

semiosic translation
    https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/sem-2016-0227/html

    The present article explains the tenets of
    an updated version of semiosic
    translation.
    
    Many of the ideas in this paper have been
    brewing forsome time.
    
    For example, the integration of the
    Peircean notions of sign and abduction and
    the Wittgensteinian concepts of
    rule-following, complex-fact,
    and hypothesis.
    
    It turns out that this synthesis leads to
    some new proposals about translation
    semiotics that seek to move the field from
    the reification of objects, concepts and
    practices toward a broader conception of
    translation and translating centered on
    the translator’s agency.
    
    What this means is, among other
    things,that semiosic translation avoids a
    delimitation of signification (things
    and actions conveying meaning) by
    rejecting any conceptual appeals tinged
    with foundationalism.
    
    Rather, my argument will concentrate on
    elucidating the unpredictability of
    semiosis as a determinant of all forms of
    translation across sign systems.

semiotics
    The study of signs and symbols and their
    use or interpretation.

zoosemiotics
    The semiotic study of the use of signs
    among animals, more precisely the study of
    semiosis among animals, i.e. the study of
    how something comes to function as a sign
    to some animal.
    
    It is the study of animal forms of
    knowing.

discourse
    Commonly speaking, the interaction between
    sense and understanding.

digress
digressing

discursive
    [#language]
    [#philosophy]

    Digressing from subject to subject.

    "students often write dull, second-hand,
    discursive prose"

    Relating to discourse or modes of
    discourse.

    "the attempt to transform utterances from
    one discursive context to another"

sign
    Anything that communicates a meaning, that
    is not the sign itself, to the interpreter
    of the sign.
    
    The meaning can be intentional such as a
    word uttered with a specific meaning, or
    unintentional, such as a symptom being a
    sign of a particular medical condition.
    
    Signs can communicate through any of the
    senses, visual, auditory, tactile,
    olfactory, or taste.

sign process
semiosis
    Any form of activity, conduct, or process
    that involves signs, including the
    production of meaning.

    Describes a process that interprets signs
    as referring to their objects, as
    described in Charles Sanders Peirce's
    theory of sign relations, or semiotics.

semiosic
    Relating to semiosis.

    The question arises, could an intellectual
    semiosis be possible that did not arise
    out of and have constantly at its disposal
    a perceptual base of cognitive materials
    with which to work?
    
    Since discourse, commonly speaking, is
    precisely this interaction between sense
    and understanding, we are asking whether
    there even can be an intellectual semiosis
    which is not discursive.
    
    Or, to put it perhaps more plainly, can
    semiosis extend even beyond the world of
    matter and motion, to achieve its effect
    and proper work also in a realm of pure
    spirits bodiless from the start?

umwelt
    [#semiotics]

    The "biological foundations that lie at
    the very epicenter of the study of both
    communication and signification in the
    human [and non-human] animal".

    The term is usually translated as "self-
    centered world".

semiotics
semiotic studies
    The study of sign process (semiosis).

    It includes the study of signs and sign
    processes, indication, designation,
    likeness, analogy, allegory, metonymy,
    metaphor, symbolism, signification, and
    communication.

    It is not to be confused with the
    Saussurean tradition called semiology,
    which is a subset of semiotics.

    The semiotic tradition explores the study
    of signs and symbols as a significant part
    of communications.

    Different from linguistics, semiotics also
    studies non-linguistic sign systems.

sign-pole

intersemiosis
intersemioticity
    Transmutation of verbal signs by nonverbal
    sign systems.

    Example:
        Language and gesture combine to make
        meaning by extending concepts
        originally developed for
        language–image relations.

intertextuality
    The shaping of a text's meaning by another
    text.
    
    It is the interconnection between similar
    or related works of literature that
    reflect and influence an audience's
    interpretation of the text.
    
    Intertextuality is the relation between
    texts that are inflicted by means of
    quotations and allusion.
